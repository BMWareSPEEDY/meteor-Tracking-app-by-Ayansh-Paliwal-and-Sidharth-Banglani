Name : 
                          Quadrantids (QUA)
                      

Peak : Jan 2-3 , 2026 night .

Details : The Quadrantids have the potential to be the strongest shower of the year but usually fall short due to the short length of maximum activity (6 hours) and the poor weather experienced during early January. The average hourly rates one can expect under dark skies is 25. These meteors usually lack persistent trains but often produce bright fireballs. Due to the high northerly declination (celestial latitude) these meteors are not well seen from the southern hemisphere.

Is it active now? : False

Visibility:  : 29.000000000000004%
Countdown:

The meteor shower PEAK date has already passed, but if it is showing active, you can watch the (slightly less bright) remains of the shower

Name : 
                          Lyrids (LYR)
                      

Peak : Apr 21-22 , 2025 night .

Details : The Lyrids are a medium strength shower that usually produces good rates for three nights centered on the maximum. These meteors also usually lack persistent trains but can produce fireballs. These meteors are best seen from the northern hemisphere where the radiant is high in the sky at dawn. Activity from this shower can be seen from the southern hemisphere, but at a lower rate.

Name : 
                          eta Aquariids (ETA)
                      

Peak : May 5-6 , 2025 night .

Details : The Eta Aquariids are a strong shower when viewed from the southern
tropics. From the equator northward, they usually  only produce medium
rates of 10-30 per hour just before dawn. Activity is good for a week
centered the night of maximum activity. These are swift meteors that
produce a high percentage of persistent trains, but few fireballs.


Is it active now? : False

Visibility:  : 54.56000000000001%
Countdown:

Name : 
                          Southern delta Aquariids (SDA)
                      

Peak : Jul 30-31 , 2025 night .

Details : The Southern delta Aquariids are another strong shower best seen from the
southern tropics. North of the equator the radiant is located lower in
the southern sky and therefore rates are less than seen from further
south. These meteors produce good rates for a week centered on the
night of maximum. These are usually faint meteors that lack both
persistent trains and fireballs.

Is it active now? : False

Name : 
                          alpha Capricornids (CAP)
                      

Peak : Jul 30-31 , 2025 night .

Details : The alpha Capricornids are active from July 3 through August 15 with a
"plateau-like" maximum centered on July 31. This shower is not very
strong and rarely produces in excess of five shower members per hour.
What is notable about this shower is the number of bright fireballs
produced during its activity period. This shower is seen equally well
on either side of the equator.

Name : 
                          Perseids (PER)
                      

Peak : Aug 11-12 , 2025 night .

Details : The Perseids are the most popular meteor shower as they peak on warm August nights as seen from the northern hemisphere. The Perseids are active from July 17 to August 24. They reach a strong maximum on August 12 or 13, depending on the year. Normal rates seen from rural locations range from 50-75 shower members per hour at maximum. The Perseids are particles released from comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle during its numerous returns to the inner solar system. They are called Perseids since the radiant (the area of the sky where the meteors seem to originate) is located near the prominent constellation of Perseus "the hero" when at maximum activity.

Is it active now? : False

Visibility:  : 35.39%

Name : 
                          Orionids (ORI)
                      

Peak : Oct 20-21 , 2025 night .

Details : The Orionids are a medium strength shower that sometimes reaches high strength activity. In a normal year the Orionids produce 10-20 shower members at maximum. In exceptional years, such as 2006-2009, the peak rates were on par with the Perseids (50-75 per hour). Recent displays have produced low to average displays of this shower.

Name : 
                          Southern Taurids (STA)
                      

Peak : Nov 4-5 , 2025 night .

Details : The Southern Taurids are a long-lasting shower with two weak maximums in mid-October and early November. The November maximum is most noticeable during fireball swarm years (2025, 2032) The shower is active for more than two months but rarely produces more than five shower members per hour, even at maximum activity. The Taurids (both branches) are rich in fireballs and are often responsible for increased number of fireball reports from September through November.

Is it active now? : False

Visibility:  : 29.000000000000004%

Peak : Nov 11-12 , 2025 night .

Details : This shower is much like the Southern Taurids, just active a bit later in the year. When the two showers are active simultaneously in late October and early November, there is sometimes an notable increase in the fireball activity.

Name : 
                          Leonids (LEO)
                      

Peak : Nov 16-17 , 2025 night .

Details : The Leonids are best known for producing meteor storms in the
years of 1833, 1866, 1966, 1999, and 2001. These outbursts of meteor
activity are best seen when the parent object, comet
55P/Tempel-Tuttle, is near perihelion (closest approach to the sun).
Yet it is not the fresh material we see from the comet, but rather
debris from earlier returns that also happen to be most dense at the
same time. Unfortunately it appears that the earth will not encounter
any dense clouds of debris until 2099. Therefore when the comet
returns in 2031 and 2064, there will be no meteor storms, but perhaps
several good displays of Leonid activity when rates are in excess of
100 per hour. The best we can hope for now until the year 2030 is
peaks of around 10 shower members per hour and perhaps an occasional
weak outburst when the earth passes near a debris trail. The Leonids
are often bright meteors with a high percentage of persistent trains.

Name : 
                          Geminids (GEM)
                      

Peak : Dec 13-14 , 2025 night .

Details : The Geminids are usually the strongest meteor shower of the year and
meteor enthusiasts are certain to circle December 13 and 14 on their
calendars. This is the one major shower that provides good activity
prior to midnight as the constellation of Gemini is well placed from
22:00 onward. The Geminids are often bright and intensely colored. Due
to their medium-slow velocity, persistent trains are not usually seen.
These meteors are also seen in the southern hemisphere, but only
during the middle of the night and at a reduced rate.

Is it active now? : False

Visibility:  : 78.7%
Countdown:

There are 329 days remaining until the peak of this meteor shower.

Name : 
                          Ursids (URS)
                      

Peak : Dec 21-22 , 2025 night .

Details : The Ursids are often neglected due to the fact it peaks just before
Christmas and the rates are much less than the Geminds, which peaks
just a week before the Ursids. Observers will normally see 5-10 Ursids
per hour during the late morning hours on the date of maximum
activity. There have been occasional outbursts when rates have
exceeded 25 per hour. These outbursts appear unrelated to the
perihelion dates of comet 8P/Tuttle. This shower is strictly a
northern hemisphere event as the radiant fails to clear the horizon or
does so simultaneously with the start of morning twilight as seen from
the southern tropics.

Is it active now? : False

Visibility:  : 97.87%
